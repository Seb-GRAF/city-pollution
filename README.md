# Aqifind

AqiFind gives you information on air pollution, letting you search for a city to learn more on its current air quality and its weather.

The app fetches data from Aqicn REST Api, and lays the data out in a user-friendly format using graphs. The main page shows a 3d globe build with ThreeJS that displays every station with an AQI (air quality index) higher than the norm.

# Project

This project was a way for me to learn a few cool libraries and frameworks that I have been eyeing out for a while. I wanted to try NextJS and its routing, its SEO friendly ways and its analytics via vercel. It was a fun challenge to learn its basics, I still have to learn how to endle SSR with its api capabilities.

I had a lot of fun learning about THREE.JS and how to model dynamic data using vectors and geometries.

This project was also a great opportunity to include Tailwind CSS in order to make styling a bit faster, especially since I already had a lot to process learning WebGL.

# Built using:

- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Three JS
- GSAP
- Aqicn API
- Unsplash API
- Mapbox
